# Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

## Description
This project covers fundamental data structures in Python, specifically lists and tuples. It includes various tasks that focus on manipulating lists, accessing elements, using tuples, and performing operations similar to those in C programming.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will:
- Understand the differences between lists and tuples
- Learn how to access, modify, and manipulate lists
- Use lists as stacks and queues
- Implement list comprehensions
- Work with tuples, including tuple packing and unpacking
- Use the `del` statement effectively

## Requirements
- Python 3.8.5 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Follow `pycodestyle` guidelines (version 2.7.*)
- All scripts must be executable and start with `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- No external modules allowed

## Files
- `0-print_list_integer.py` - Print all integers of a list
- `1-element_at.py` - Retrieve an element from a list
- `2-replace_in_list.py` - Replace an element in a list
- `3-print_reversed_list_integer.py` - Print a list in reverse
- `4-new_in_list.py` - Replace an element without modifying the original list
- `5-no_c.py` - Remove 'c' and 'C' from a string
- `6-print_matrix_integer.py` - Print a matrix of integers
- `7-add_tuple.py` - Add two tuples
- `8-multiple_returns.py` - Return tuple with string length and first character
- `9-max_integer.py` - Find the maximum integer in a list
- `10-divisible_by_2.py` - Identify multiples of 2 in a list
- `11-delete_at.py` - Delete an element at a specific position
- `12-switch.py` - Swap values of two variables

## Usage
Run the scripts using Python 3:
```bash
./0-main.py
```
Ensure each script is executable before running:
```bash
chmod +x filename.py
```
