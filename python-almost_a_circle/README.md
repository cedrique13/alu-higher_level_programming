# Python Classes & Unit Testing Project

## Description

This project focuses on core Python concepts including class serialization/deserialization, JSON manipulation, usage of `*args` and `**kwargs`, and unit testing with the `unittest` module. The goal is to build scalable, readable, and testable Python code, while adhering to strict coding and documentation standards.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to confidently explain and apply the following concepts:

- ✅ What is Unit Testing and how to implement it in a large project  
- ✅ How to serialize and deserialize a class  
- ✅ How to write to and read from a JSON file  
- ✅ What is `*args` and how to use it  
- ✅ What is `**kwargs` and how to use it  
- ✅ How to handle named arguments in a function

## Project Structure

```
.
├── models/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── base.py
│   └── ...
├── tests/
│   ├── test_models/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── test_base.py
│   │   └── ...
├── README.md
└── main.py
```

- All tests are organized under the `tests/` folder.
- File organization in `tests/` mirrors that of the main project files.

---

## Requirements

- **Python version**: 3.8.5  
- **OS**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS  

### Python Scripts

- Must end with a new line
- Must start with: `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Must pass `pycodestyle` (version 2.7.*)
- Must be executable: `chmod +x <filename>`
- Must include **complete and meaningful documentation** for:
  - Modules
  - Classes
  - Functions (inside and outside classes)

### Unit Tests

- Use the `unittest` module
- Test files must be `.py` files
- All test files should start with `test_`
- Organize tests to mirror the main file structure
- All tests should be placed inside a `tests` directory

---

## Running Tests

To run all test cases:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover tests
```

To run a specific test file:

```bash
python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base.py
```

---

## Tips

- Use `*args` when your function needs to accept any number of positional arguments.
- Use `**kwargs` when your function needs to accept any number of keyword (named) arguments.
- Use `json.dump()` and `json.load()` for writing to and reading from JSON files.
- Use `unittest.TestCase` to structure your tests and ensure test coverage.
- Make sure your documentation is not just a word or phrase. It must clearly explain the purpose of the module/class/function.
