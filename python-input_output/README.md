# Python - Input/Output

## Overview

This directory contains projects related to reading and writing files in Python, as well as working with JSON data. The tasks are designed to deepen your understanding of file handling and data serialization in Python.

## Learning Objectives

- How to read and write files in Python.
- The importance of using the `with` statement.
- How to work with file pointers and cursor movement.
- The concepts of JSON serialization and deserialization.
- How to convert Python data structures to JSON and vice versa.

## Requirements

- All scripts should be written in Python 3 (version 3.8.5) and executed on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- Follow the `pycodestyle` guidelines (version 2.7.\*).
- The first line of every script must be `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- All files should end with a new line.
- Create a `README.md` at the root of the project directory.
- All test cases should be stored inside the `tests` folder and executed using `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`.

## Tasks Overview

1. **Read file:** Read a text file and print its content to stdout.
2. **Write to a file:** Write a string to a file and return the number of characters written.
3. **Append to a file:** Append a string at the end of a file and return the number of characters added.
4. **To JSON string:** Convert a Python object to its JSON representation.
5. **From JSON string to Object:** Convert a JSON string to a Python object.
6. **Save Object to a file:** Write a Python object to a file using JSON serialization.
7. **Create object from a JSON file:** Read a JSON file and convert its content to a Python object.
8. **Load, add, save:** Add all command-line arguments to a list and save it in a JSON file.
9. **Class to JSON:** Return the dictionary description of a simple data structure.
