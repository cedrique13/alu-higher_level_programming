# JavaScript - Web Scraping

This project focuses on practicing basic web scraping techniques using JavaScript. It involves reading and writing files, making HTTP requests, working with APIs, and handling JSON data.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, one will understand:

- The power and versatility of JavaScript in web scraping
- How to manipulate and parse JSON data
- How to use the `request` and `fetch` APIs
- How to read from and write to files using the `fs` module in Node.js

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript (Node.js)
- `fs` module
- `request` module (deprecated but still widely used for learning)
- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Node.js v10.14.x)

## Requirements

- Use of `#!/usr/bin/node` as the first line in each script
- Code must follow `semistandard` style (Standard style + semicolons)
- No use of `var`; use `const` or `let`
- All scripts must be executable
- UTF-8 encoding for reading and writing files
