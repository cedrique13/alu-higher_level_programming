# Python More Classes and Objects

## Project Description
This project focuses on deepening understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, exploring advanced class and object concepts through a progressive implementation of a Rectangle class.

## Learning Objectives

- The fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming
- How to define and work with classes and instances
- Understanding attributes (public, protected, private)
- Implementing class and instance methods
- Working with special methods like `__init__`, `__str__`, and `__repr__`
- Exploring class attributes and methods
- Creating more complex class interactions

## Tasks Overview
The project consists of nine progressive tasks that build a Rectangle class with increasingly sophisticated features:
0. Simple empty Rectangle class
1. Rectangle with width and height validation
2. Adding area and perimeter calculations
3. String representation of Rectangle
4. Representation for eval() recreation
5. Instance deletion detection
6. Tracking number of instances
7. Customizable print symbol
8. Rectangle comparison
9. Creating squares from rectangles

## Requirements
- Python 3.8.5
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
