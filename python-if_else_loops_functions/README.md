# Python - if/else, loops, functions

## Overview

This project focuses on fundamental Python programming concepts, including control flow, loops, functions, and variable scope. The tasks help build a solid foundation in Python by emphasizing structured coding practices.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain and demonstrate:

- The importance of indentation in Python.
- How to use `if`, `if ... else` statements.
- Writing and using loops (`for` and `while`).
- How Python’s `for` loop differs from C’s `for` loop.
- Utilizing `break`, `continue`, and `pass` statements.
- The use of the `range()` function.
- Writing and calling functions in Python.
- Understanding variable scope.
- Identifying and handling tracebacks.
- Using arithmetic operators in Python.

## Requirements

- All code should be written in Python 3 (version 3.8.5) on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- Follow `pycodestyle` guidelines (version 2.7.\*).
- Use allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, or `emacs`.
- Include a `README.md` file at the root of the project.
- Make all scripts executable.
- Each file should start with `#!/usr/bin/python3`.

## Task Breakdown

### 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing

Prints whether a randomly generated number is positive, negative, or zero.

### 1. The last digit

Prints the last digit of a random number and categorizes it.

### 2. Alphabet printing

Prints the lowercase alphabet in a single line.

### 3. Alphabet soup

Prints the alphabet, excluding `q` and `e`.

### 4. Hexadecimal printing

Prints numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and hexadecimal formats.

### 5. 00...99

Prints numbers from 00 to 99 in a formatted manner.

### 6. Two-digit combinations

Prints all possible different combinations of two digits in ascending order.

### 7. islower

Function that checks if a character is lowercase.

### 8. To uppercase

Function that prints a string in uppercase without using built-in string methods like `str.upper()`.

### 9. Last digit function

Function that prints the last digit of a number.

## Usage

Ensure all scripts are executable by running:

```sh
chmod +x filename.py
```

Execute the scripts using:

```sh
./filename.py
```
