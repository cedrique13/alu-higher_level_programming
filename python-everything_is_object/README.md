# Python - Everything is Object

## Project Description
This project explores the fundamental concept that everything in Python is an object, diving deep into object behavior, mutability, and memory management.

## Learning Objectives
- Understanding what an object is in Python
- Differences between mutable and immutable objects
- Object references and assignments
- How Python handles variables and memory
- Object identification and comparison
- Behavior of different types of objects

## Project Tasks
The project consists of various tasks that test understanding of:
- Object type identification
- Object memory addresses
- Object comparison (== vs is)
- Behavior of different object types
- List and tuple operations
- Object mutability
- Function argument passing

## Key Concepts Explored
- Object identity
- Reference vs value
- Immutable vs mutable types
- Memory allocation
- Object comparison methods

## Requirements
- Python 3.8.5
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
